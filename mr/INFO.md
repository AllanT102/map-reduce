## Team Members:
1. Nelson Li (nelsonl1)
2. Allan Tan (at102)

## Responsibilities

- Allan worked on the coordinator and its RPCs while Nelson worked on the worker (map and reduce). Both of us worked together to help plan out the design and debug concurrency / fault tolerance.
- We both worked on debugging.

## GenAI Use

Nelson asked ChatGPT for help with some GO syntax issues and for help when debugging concurrency issues.
Allan also used ChatGPT when debugging concurrency issues. For example, asking GPT where deadlocks can occur in the function that is being debugged.
